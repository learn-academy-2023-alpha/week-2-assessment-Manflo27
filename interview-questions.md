# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. 
Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: Both parameter and arguments are apart of a function. The argument is the value that is being passed in the parameter. 
A parameter is the place holder for the argument that is being passed. The parameter is the function that is being passed as the 
arguement represents the output of that function. 

Researched answer: A function contains the parameter that is is being passed in parenthesis. Functions have to be closed in order for the 
logic to be received,therefore an argument creates the output outside the function. The argument must contain the data type that is being passed. 
If (name) is passed in the paramter, the argument must be a data type that is recognized by the parameter that is passed. 

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The three built in method types are value, index and array. The one that is required is value as it is the first output. 
The index will and array are the location of the elements and the array is outputing the whole array. Value is always first, 
Index is second and Array is third. It is imperative to understanbd the order of this as its always the output.

Researched answer: The predifined parameters are the current value, the index and the array. The value is required, the index and array are optional. 
The returned value is the logic that was iterated through the array in the function. The output of the value returns the original array with different 
values based upon the logic in the function.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: .map iterates through an array and outputs the original array, .filter iterates through an array but returns only 
the specified condition.An example of .map is muliplying an array and getting the output of each number in that array multiplied 
by a number. An example of .filter is is returning an array with only odd numbers.

Researched answer: The differences in map and filter is how they return, .map returns the original array as .filter returns a subset of the array based
off the condition.Both built in methods iterate over an array like a for loop. 

1. What is iteration? Iteration is the process of starting from an index in the array and going through each element to perform logic. 
For loops start at a certain index and return whether its true or false. Iteration in .map is going through each element and returning 
the elements in the array with a certain result of the return.

Your answer: Iteration is a sequence that is performed until a condition is met. The iteration will keep running until that conidtion is met. 
Many programs exist where it will keep running or iterating until the condition is met. 

Researched answer: Iteration is the process of executing the code until a condition is met. The iteration will only stop until the condition is false. 

1. What is the difference between a function and a method? 
A function is reusable pieces of code that allows an input and output. Objects contain methods that
the function belong to. A method would appear different from a function as the method is referencing the object. 

Your answer: A function is a set of instructions to carry out a certain task. A method is instructions that are related to an object. The method is dependant 
on the object as opposed to a function that is independant. Methods need to delcare the class as functions are independant in that aspect as well. 

Researched answer: Methods are functions that belong to an object, "this" references the object name inside the object. Methods only belong to that object while functions perfrom a set of rules to perfrom a task. Functions can be used over and over while methods only belong to that object class.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting is declaring the code before it is executed. It's a type of behavior that allows all declarations to the top. It allows the use
of the variable's value before being declared.  

Researched answer: Hoisting is a action inn which a varibale or function can be used before being proclaimed. Hosting a declaration moves it to the top of the scope. Hoisting can cause different outcomes so it is best to avoid using hoisting.  

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Classes: Classes are a function that contain data and behavior for objects. The keywords for classes consist of constructor, this and new. The constructor creates 
the object. This is referring to the identification of the object. New is creating a whole new class to that object. Classes are capitalized from the first word unlike camelcase words.

2. Spread operator: Allows for two or more strings/arrays to be together wihtout using concatenation. The spread operator takes an array or string and expands it into its own elements. The syntax for a spread operator is three dots. Its useful for copying other exisiting arrays or objecs into another entirely new array or object. 

3. React state: React components store data and perfrom logic.In a React,the React hook allows to implement a variable with a value and a method to update the value as needed.

4. React props: Props are a type of object where the tag attributes are stored, prop is referred to property. Props are passed by HTML attributes.Props also known as properties are considered arguments. 

5. DOM events: Users are allowed interaction either with their mouse or keyboard. The interactions taht are being displayed are considered DOM events. The onClick button allows DOM events to be executed.
